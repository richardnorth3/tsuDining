# tsuDining
TSU Dining is a mobile application written in Swift 2.0 and created in Xcode. I attend Texas Southern University and work for the Information Technology department. As of now there is not a dining application available for my campus so I took the initiative to create one. My department loved the idea and said make it happen and so I did. 

Features of the app: 
    being able to look at a snapshot of each dining location on campus
    view hours of operation of each dining location
    look at the menu of food items thats are commonly served along with their respective nutrition facts
    users will be able to check their dining point balance
    users will be able to submit suggestions referencing the app or their dining experiences

Right now it is not available in the app store to download nor is there an android version yet. However, if you want to compile and run the application in Xcode on your machine, you are more than welcome! :)
