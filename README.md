# tsuDining
TSU Dining is a mobile application written in Swift 2.0 and created in Xcode. I attend Texas Southern University and work for the Information Technology department. As of now there is not a dining application available for my campus so I took the initiative to create one. My department loved the idea and said make it happen and so I did. Right now it is not available in the app store to download nor an android version yet. However, if you want to compile and run the application in Xcode on your machine, you are more than welcome! :)
